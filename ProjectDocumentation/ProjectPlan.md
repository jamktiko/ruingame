### 
**Daily Scrum Plan**

All scrum related activities require active participation from all team members.

Sprint planning will be held during Monday on the first day of the sprint. The time reserved will be 2 hours. The user stories that are selected during the sprint planning are to be completed during that sprint. Minutes will be produced from this meeting.

The first hour of the work day is dedicated for daily scrum. The daily scrum will be held after 30 minutes in the work day and it should be done in 30 minutes, after getting used to the process the length of daily scrum will be reduced to 15 minutes. All members of the team decide what they are going to do during this meeting, they will also tell what they have done since the last meeting and bring up any issues with their work. \

In addition, there is a general voice-channel for general discussion and meetings, and there are also text-channels for different subjects. Teams will also be used for communications.
